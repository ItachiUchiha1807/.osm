Open street map file 
Openstreetmap (www.openstreetmap.org) is a free and open resource which provides high
quality map data for all areas in the world. They provide the data in the OSM format which can
be downloaded from their website. OSM is an xml-based format, which has various elements and
the attributes for those elements. The purpose of this assignment is to develop a software which
reads data about various artifacts on the map, and provide a text searchable interface to the
map.
An OSM file of the Kharagpur area is given to you for reference.
